# Pizza Bot

We created a pizzabot using JavaScript, html and some css. In short you are able to order 3 different kinds of pizza, you enter the number of pizzas you would like and get info on total price and total cookingtime in the end of your order.

## The problem

Since this was a pair-programming project, we started out by just being clear on how we wanted to work together and cooperate. We set up some ground rules – noone should run faster than the other, always make sure that we both understand everything that's happening, and take turns in being the driver and the navigator. 

After the initial discussion around collaboration, we started dissecting the project brief, and hit the ground running with iteration 1. The pair-programming worked well, and we took turns in being the driver and navigator for the remaining iterations. 

The tools we used were fairly basic – nothing other than your everyday HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We found a Github gist by Van on how to make recursive functions, which was really helpful. 

### If you had more time, what would be next?

If we had more time, we would have loved to try to make the bot a little more interactive. Even though we managed to present our chat in a fairly nice-looking way, we didn't have time to get started on using forms for input – so we settled for the prompts and alerts.
